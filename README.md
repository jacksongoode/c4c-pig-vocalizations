# Summary 
This project was developed as part of Code 4 Compassion Hackathon 2025. The goal was to validate and extend the implementation from this [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-07174-8). The original authors sought to develop a model that could classify the emotional valence of pigs throughout all stages of life. Although the original code was written in MATLAB, we aimed to refactor the original code in Python to make it more accessible and portable. A quick web interface was put together to demonstrate one implementation of the user workflow. 

In a future, more mature implementation, the application would be able to access live audio recordings (e.g., from a mobile device), process the streamed data, and generate predictions of the valence of the pig calls in real-time. As an example, we can envision this application being useful in cases where factory farm practices must be validated and/or monitored and held accountable.
